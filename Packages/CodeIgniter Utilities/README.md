This is a [Sublime Text][sublime] package that plans to include a complete list of snippets for all classes, libraries and helpers on [CodeIgniter][ci] PHP framework. Inspired on Marco Monteiro [CI-Snippets][ci-repo] and David Ferguson [CI TextMate Bunddle][ci-bunddle]

## Installation ##

If you have [Package Control][package_control] installed, you can get CodeIgniter Utilities easily using this following steps:

	1.- Open command palette.
	2.- Type / Search for "Package Control: Install Package"
	3.- Type "CodeIgniter Utilities" to install it.

To install it manually without Package control, you will need to make a clone of this repository into your packages folder, like so:

    git clone https://github.com/roverwire/codeigniter-utilities.git

All the triggers begin with "ci" to avoid conflicts with other snippets.
