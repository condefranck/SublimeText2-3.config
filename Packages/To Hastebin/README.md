#ToHastebin!
---------------------

A Sublime Text 2 plugin built to upload code directly from the editor to Hastebin.com with the correct syntax highlighting!

###Usage

Select text, hit the key binding (`ctrl+alt+c`) and the HasteBin url will be copied to your clipboard, with syntax detection included.


Installing
----------
**With the Package Control plugin:** The easiest way to install ToHastebin is through Package Control, which can be found at this site: http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control

Once you install Package Control, restart ST2 and bring up the Command Palette (`Command+Shift+P` on OS X, `Control+Shift+P` on Linux/Windows). Select "Package Control: Install Package", wait while Package Control fetches the latest package list, then select ToHastebin when the list appears. The advantage of using this method is that Package Control will automatically keep ToHastebin up to date with the latest version.

**Without Git:** Download the latest source from [GitHub](https://github.com/s3anno/SublimeToHastebin) and copy the ToHastebin folder to your Sublime Text "Packages" directory.

**With Git:** Clone the repository in your Sublime Text "Packages" directory:

    git clone https://github.com/s3anno/SublimeToHastebin.git


The "Packages" directory is located at:

* OS X:

        ~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages/

* Linux:

        ~/.config/sublime-text-2/Packages/

        %APPDATA%/Sublime Text 2/Packages/
